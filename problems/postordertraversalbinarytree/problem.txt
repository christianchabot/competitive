Postorder Traversal of Binary Tree Without Recrusion (Iterative)

Problem statement:
Traversing elements in postorder traversal with recursion is easy.
You have given a binary tree. Implement post order traversal without recrusion.

Example:
    4
   / \
  1   5
 / \   \
7   3   6

The postorder traversal of the Binary Tree is 7 3 1 6 5 4
