Flip Equivalent Binary Trees

This is one of the popular coding challenges on the binary tree.
Let's understand the flip operation first.
For a binary tree, we can define a flip operation as follows: choose any node, and swap the left and right child subtrees.

What are flip equivalent binary trees?
A binary tree T1 is flip equivalent to binary tree T2 if and only if we can make T1 equal to T2 after some number of flip operations.

Problem Statement:
Given the roots of two binary trees root1 and root2, return true if the two trees are flip equivalent or false otherwise.
