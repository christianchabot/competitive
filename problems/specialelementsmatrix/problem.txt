Specail Elements in Matrix

Problem Statement: Special Elements in Matrix

Given a matrix of size m*n, m denotes the row starting with index 0 and n denotes the column starting with index 0.

The matrix will hold distinct integers as elements.

We need to find a distinct number of positional elements which are either the minimum or maximum in their corresponding row or column.

Please return -1 if any row or any column has multiple minimum or maximum elements.

For example, given a matrix of size 3*3, the elements are stored as follows.

1 3 4
5 2 9
8 7 6

The expected output is 7.

In the above example, we identified the output as 7 based on below.

1 - minimum in row and column
4 - Maximum in row
2 - Minimum in column and row
9 - Maximum in row and column
8 - Maximum in row and column
7 - Maximum in column
6 - Minimum in row

Input:
m - integer - number of rows
n - integer - number of columns
m * n matrix

Output:
r - integer result

Constraints:

0<m,n<100
Elements in the matrix are positive integers.
