Sum of Sub-arrays

An array X consists of N elements. You are given an integer K.

Write a program to find the sum of the lengths of the sub-arrays with K as its maximum number. Any two sub-arrays that are considered should not overlap each other. Find the maximum possible sum.

Input format:
First line: T (number of test cases)
First line: N, and K
Second line: N space-separated integers (denoting the elements of the array)

Output format:
For each test case, print the maximum sum.
