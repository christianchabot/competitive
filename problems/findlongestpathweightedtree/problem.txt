Find Longest Path in a Weighted Tree

Problem statement:
Write a program to find the longest/maximum path in a weighted tree.

What is a Weighted Tree?
It is a tree in which every edge will be assigned with a number. It is also called edge distance between two connected nodes.

Example:

        A
       / \
      4   3
     /     \
    B       C
    |      /|\
    2     4 2 1
    |    /  |  \
    D   E   F   G
            |
            1
            |
            H

In the above tree example: The weight of the edge connecting nodes 'A' and 'B' is 4. Similarly, the weight of the edge connecting nodes 'C' and 'F' is 4.
The longest path in a weighted tree is 7 (4+3) from node 'A' to 'C' (A-C-E)
