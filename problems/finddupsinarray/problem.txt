Find Duplicate in Array in O(n) Linear Time

Problem Statement:
An array contains n numbers from 0 to n-1. There are some numbers duplicated in the array.
It is not clear how many numbers are duplicated or how many times a number gets duplicated.
How do you find a duplicated number in the array?

Example:
If and array of length 7 contains the numbers {2, 3, 1, 0, 2, 5, 3}, the implemented function (or method) should return either 2 or 3.
