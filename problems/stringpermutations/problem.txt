String Permutation in Python without itertools

Problem statement:
Write a program to find all the permutations of the string in Python without itertools.

What is permutation?
A permutation is a technique that is used to determine all the strings obtained by rearranging the characters.

Example:
	- The permutations of string "ab" is ['ab', 'ba'].
	- The permutations of string "abc" is ['abc', 'acb', 'bac', 'bca', 'cba', 'cab'].

The number that can be formed from the string is !n (n factorial).
Where, n is the length of the given string.
