Does it Divide?

This problem is asked in the HackerEarth contest.

Problem Statement:
Consider a permutation of numbers from 1 to N written on a paper. Let's denote the product of its element as 'prod' and the sum of its elements as 'sum'. Given a positive integer N, your task is to determine whether 'prod' is divisible by 'sum' or not.

Input Format:
First input will be an integer T. It depicts a number of test cases. Followed by the value for each test case. Each test case will contain an integer N (1 <= N <= 10^9). It is nothing but the length of the permutation.

Output Format:
For each test case, print "YEAH" if 'prod' is divisible by 'sum', otherwise print "NAH".
