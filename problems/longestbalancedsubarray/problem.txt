Longest Balanced Substring | Maximum Length of Balanced Parentheses

You have given a string that contains the curly braces (brackets), both opending and closing braces. You have to find the length of the longest balanced subarray.

Example:
Input: {}{}{
Output:4

Explanation:
In the above example, the length of the longest subarray/substring is four ( {}{} ).

There can be multiple balanced subarrays. IN that case, you have to return the length of the longest balanced (valid) subarray.
