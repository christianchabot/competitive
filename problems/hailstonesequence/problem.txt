Hailstone Sequence Algorithm

Take a number (says 'n') as an input.

Print the value of 'n'.

while n != 1
	a) Print the value of 'n'
	b) If 'n' is odd, calculate the next number as n*3+1
	c) if 'n' is even, calculate the next number as n/2.

Example:

Input: 10
Output (Hailstone Sequence): 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

Input: 17
Output (Hailstone Sequence): 17 -> 52 -> 26 -> 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

Problem statement:
Write a probram that prints all hailstone sequences with starting numbers from 1 to n and prints the number that has the longest hailstone sequnece.
You have to find the seed having the maximum length of the hailstone sequence for the hailstone sequences for all the numbers in the range of given numbers.

Algorithm:
Take two numbers as input (a, and b).
Find a hailstone sequnece length of all the values ranging from a to b.
Return maximum length out of all the lengths of hailstone sequences.
