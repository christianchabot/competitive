Design Music Player with Shuffle Feature

Problem statement:
Design and implement a music player which has a shuffle feature. Make sure shuffle doesn't repeat songs.

Requirement gathering:
Whenever you get this question in the interview, understand all the requirements. If something is not clear, ask the interviewer.

Following features and requirements should be added to the music player.
	- Shuffle song playlist. (Song should not be repeated songs. It means if the song is already played, don't consider it.)
	- Add a song to the play song queue.
	- Play a song from the queue.

If you use any of the mobile app music players (like Spotify, Wynk, etc) you will see these basic features in the app.
