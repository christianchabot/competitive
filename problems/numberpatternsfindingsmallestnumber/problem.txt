Number Patterns and Finding the Possible Smallest Numeric Value

Problem Statement:
Question: Given a pattern containing only Ns and Ms. N represents ascending and M represents descending. Each character (M or N) needs to display a sequence of numbers (2 numbers) explaining the ascending and descending order (for ex: 21 -> represents the ascending -> M). The second character in the patterns takes the last digit from the first character builds the sequence and so on. Please look at the examples section below.

There could be multiple numbers satisfying the patterns. The goal is to find out the lowest numeric value following the pattern.

Here are some constraints to this problem:
Input can have a maximum of 8 characters.
Output can have Digit from 1-9 and Digits can't repeat.
In case of no possible output or incorrect input value (like blank/ null/ NON M or N character), kindly return -1.

Example:
Input: M
Output: 21

Explanation 2 -> 1 shows descending and possible smallest numeric value.
Even 65 or 75 can qualify, but 21 being the smallest numeric value is the correct answer.

Input: MNM
Output:
2143

Explanation: M represents descending 2 -> 1. N represents ascending 1 -> 4 (1 is coming from the last character). M represent descending 4 -> 3 (4 is coming from the last character sequence). There would be many numbers qualifying the pattern lke 3142, 8796, 6241, etc. 2143 is the lowest numeric value for this pattern sequence.
