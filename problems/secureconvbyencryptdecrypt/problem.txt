Secure My Conversation by Encryption and Decryption

Person A and B use an encryptoin-based system for their conversatoin.
Each conversation message is encrypted from the source and decrypted in the destination using a shared private positive number key known to each other.
The algorithm is illustrated with an example.

Input format with explanation:
1. Operation (1 for Encryption and 2 for Decryption)
2. Input message
3. Input private key

Output format with explanation:
1. Output message

Example 1:
Input:

1
Open
123

Output:
Oppeeen
Here, the input message characters are duplicated based on each digit in the key.

Example 2:
Input:

2
Oppeeen
123

Output:

Open

Here, the input message characters are compressed vased on each digit in the key.
The conversation message and the private key need NOT be in equal length and the encoding/decoding takes place till the end is reached either conversation message or private key while retaining the rest of the conversation message.
